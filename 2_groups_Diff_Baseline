# Example for my students: to answerthe  question How to test for significance if groups differed at baseline?

# Comparing the blood pressure of men and women before and after exercise over the course of one week, you would likely use a repeated measures design with a factorial structure. 
# This design would allow you to examine the effects of both gender and time (before vs. after exercise) on blood pressure.

Here's how you could structure your study:

Factor 1: Gender

Group 1: Men
Group 2: Women
Factor 2: Time

Time 1: Before exercise
Time 2: After exercise (measured repeatedly over the course of one week)

Each participant (both men and women) would have their blood pressure measured at two different times: before exercise and after exercise, with measurements taken repeatedly over the course of one week.

To analyze the data, you could use a repeated measures ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) or a linear mixed-effects model to assess the main effects of gender and time, as well as any interactions between the two factors, on blood pressure. 
This approach would allow you to determine whether there are significant differences in blood pressure between men and women, as well as whether blood pressure changes significantly before and after exercise within each gender group, 
and whether these changes differ between men and women.

In summary:

Repeated measures design: Allows for the examination of within-subject changes over time, such as blood pressure before and after exercise.
Factorial structure: Enables the simultaneous examination of multiple factors (gender and time) and their interactions on the outcome variable (blood pressure).
Statistical analysis: Typically involves repeated measures ANOVA or linear mixed-effects modeling to assess main effects and interactions.

Example 2 =================================
How to test for significance if groups differed at baseline?
What kind of statistical significance test can I do to rectify this situation?

Example data:

TREATED (received marketing, measured product ownership before and after test was conducted)

N = 150,000
% that own product before marketing = 55.0%
% that own the product after marketing = 57.5%
CONTROL (did not receive marketing, but we measured product ownership before and after the test was conducted as well)

N = 50,000
% that own product before = 53.2% *(statistically different than TREATED's 55%)
% that own the product after = 56.2%

To test for the significance of differences between groups when they differed at baseline, also can be used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). 
ANCOVA is an extension of analysis of variance (ANOVA) that allows you to compare group means while controlling for the effects of covariates.

In this case, the covariate is the baseline measure of product ownership. By including the baseline measure as a covariate in the analysis, you can adjust for any initial differences between the treated and control groups.

Perform an ANCOVA analysis in 3 steps:

1. Calculate the change in product ownership for each group:
TREATED: 57.5% - 55.0% = 2.5%
CONTROL: 56.2% - 53.2% = 3.0%

2. Perform ANCOVA analysis:
Use the change in product ownership as the dependent variable.
Use group membership (TREATED vs. CONTROL) as the independent variable.
Include the baseline measure of product ownership as a covariate.

3. Interpret the results:
The ANCOVA analysis will provide p-values for the main effect of group (TREATED vs. CONTROL) and the covariate (baseline product ownership).
A significant main effect of group indicates that there is a difference in the change in product ownership between the treated and control groups, after adjusting for baseline differences.
A significant main effect of the covariate indicates that baseline product ownership has an effect on the change in product ownership, independent of group membership.
By including the baseline measure as a covariate in the analysis, you can more accurately assess the effect of the treatment (marketing) on product ownership while controlling for any initial differences between the groups.

Keep in mind that ANCOVA assumes that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable is linear and that there is homogeneity of regression slopes across groups. 
Additionally, be cautious of potential confounding variables that may affect the results of the analysis.


# Example data generation=============================
treated_before <- 55.0
treated_after <- 57.5
control_before <- 53.2
control_after <- 56.2

# Calculate change in product ownership
treated_change <- treated_after - treated_before
control_change <- control_after - control_before

# Create data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Group = c("TREATED", "CONTROL"),
  Before = c(treated_before, control_before),
  After = c(treated_after, control_after),
  Change = c(treated_change, control_change)
)
data %>% head

#    Group Before After Change
#1 TREATED   55.0  57.5    2.5
#2 CONTROL   53.2  56.2    3.0


# Perform ANCOVA analysis
result <- lm(Change ~ Group + Baseline, data = data)

# Summarize results
summary(result)
