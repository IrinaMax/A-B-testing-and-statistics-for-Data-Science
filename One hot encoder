One Hote encored in R
d <- factor(1:10)

height <- round(175 + rnorm(10)*10)

nationality <- c("AUS","UK","NZ","NZ","AUS","UK","NZ","UK","NZ","NZ")

mydata <- data.frame(cbind(id,height,nationality))

One hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors.  What this means is that we want to 

transform a categorical variable or variables to a format that works better with classification and regression algorithms.
We also sometimes call these dummy variables.
We want to create new columns, one for each nationality. Each new column will have a 1 or a 0 to show whether each person is from that country or not.  While there are packages in R designed to do 
this ('dummies' for example) - one way to do this in base R, is using a loop.

for(unique_value in unique(mydata$nationality)){
 

mydata[paste("nationality", unique_value, sep = ".")] <- ifelse(mydata$nationality == unique_value, 1, 0)

}
